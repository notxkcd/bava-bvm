Define different stages of a defect

1. New (or Open)
Description: This is the initial stage when a defect is first reported or discovered.
Actions: The defect has been logged into the defect tracking system with all necessary details like description, steps to reproduce, environment details, severity, and priority.
2. Assigned
Description: The defect has been assigned to a developer or a team responsible for fixing it.
Actions: The assignee acknowledges the defect and begins to work on understanding and reproducing it if necessary.

3. In Progress
Description: The developer has started investigating and fixing the defect.
Actions: The developer is actively working on identifying the root cause and implementing a solution.

4. Fixed (or Ready for Retest)
Description: The defect has been fixed in the codebase by the developer.
Actions: The fix has been implemented, and the code changes have been committed to the version control system.

5. Retest
Description: The fixed defect is retested by the testing team.
Actions: Testers verify if the defect has been resolved and ensure that the fix did not introduce any new issues (regressions).

6. Verified (or Closed)
Description: The defect has been successfully retested and verified as fixed.
Actions: Testers confirm that the defect no longer occurs and meets the acceptance criteria defined during its discovery.

7. Reopened (or Rejected)
Description: Sometimes, defects may be reopened if they reoccur or if the fix did not completely resolve the issue.
Actions: If the defect reappears after being closed, it is reopened for further investigation and resolution.

8. Deferred
Description: Some defects, especially those considered low priority or with minimal impact, may be postponed to be fixed in a future release or iteration.
Actions: The decision is made to defer the defect based on priorities and release timelines.

9. Duplicate
Description: If the same defect is reported more than once, either by different users or in different contexts, they are marked as duplicates.
Actions: The duplicate defects are consolidated into a single defect report to avoid redundancy.

10. Not a Defect (or Not Reproducible)
Description: Sometimes, defects reported may not be actual issues. This stage is used to indicate that the reported behavior is expected or cannot be reproduced.
Actions: The defect is analyzed and determined to be either user error, misunderstanding, or a non-issue.

Note: Please ensure you attach proper screenshots or artifacts to counter against Not a Defect or Not Reproducible defects.
